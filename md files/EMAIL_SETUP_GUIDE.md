```

### Debug Mode:
Add this to see detailed email logs:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Production Considerations

### For Production Deployment:
1. **Use dedicated email service** (SendGrid, AWS SES, Mailgun)
2. **Set up SPF/DKIM records** for better deliverability
3. **Use environment variables** for all credentials
4. **Monitor email sending** with proper logging
5. **Set up email templates** in HTML format

### Recommended Services:
- **SendGrid** - Easy setup, good free tier
- **AWS SES** - Cost-effective for high volume
- **Mailgun** - Developer-friendly API
- **Postmark** - High deliverability rates
